# Open-source readiness checklist

This checklist prepares the repository; it does not authorize making it public.

## Completed on 2026-09-14

- [x] Accurate runtime, environment, architecture, and verification README.
- [x] Secret-safe `.env.example` matching the current service boundary.
- [x] Initial test and `npm run check` quality gate.
- [x] CI definition for the quality gate.
- [x] Contributor and security guidance.
- [x] Current changed-file credential-pattern scan found no credential-shaped
      values.
- [x] Bounded Git-history string scan found only placeholder/empty examples for
      the matched retired-provider and WhatsApp keys.
- [x] `npm audit --audit-level=low` reports zero known vulnerabilities.
- [x] Direct dependency manifests expose only MIT, Apache-2.0, or BSD-2-Clause
      licenses; detailed evidence is in `DEPENDENCY_REVIEW.md`.
- [x] Dedicated Gitleaks full-history scan completed with redacted output; the
      sanitized review is in `SECURITY_HISTORY_REVIEW.md`.

## Required before public visibility

- [x] Owner selected AGPL-3.0-only on 2026-09-19; canonical `LICENSE` added and
      package metadata aligned.
- [ ] Rewrite the retired-provider reference from Git history and rerun Gitleaks
      to zero unresolved findings.
- [x] Inventory transitive dependency licenses and assets in
      `PUBLICATION_RIGHTS_REVIEW.md`.
- [ ] Replace or explicitly accept the unmaintained media wrapper and its
      transitive package with missing license metadata.
- [ ] Remove or document obsolete dependencies, routes, environment variables,
      and provider references.
- [ ] Document production deployment without exposing infrastructure secrets.
- [ ] Enable private vulnerability reporting and appropriate branch protection.
- [ ] Confirm CI on a pull request from a clean clone.
- [x] Owner approved public visibility on 2026-09-15.
- [ ] Verify GitHub's public readback and clean-clone setup flow.

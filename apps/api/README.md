# DoryAI backend

The private service boundary for DoryAI chat and content processing. It accepts
authenticated service-to-service requests from Convex, calls Gemini, extracts
supported media, and writes user-scoped results back through privileged Convex
functions.

The GitHub repository and package retain the historical `clippo-backend` name.
DoryAI is the current product name.

The cross-repository runtime and trust-boundary map lives in
`../web-app/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` in the shared local workspace.
The in-progress saved-link search design, backfill gate, and release checks
live in `../web-app/docs/SEARCH.md`; this feature is not in production yet.

## Local setup

Requirements: a current Node.js LTS release, npm, the web/Convex project in
`../web-app`, and `ffmpeg` plus Python/yt-dlp for full Instagram/TikTok media
processing. When Python is unavailable, the current implementation deliberately
falls back to metadata-only results.

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Set the same `CONVEX_BACKEND_SECRET` value in this `.env` and the Convex server
environment. Never expose it to browser code or commit real values.

## Environment

```dotenv
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
CONVEX_URL=https://replace-me.convex.cloud
CONVEX_BACKEND_SECRET=replace-with-a-shared-random-secret
GEMINI_API_KEY=replace_me
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=
```

`GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` is accepted as a fallback for the social-media service, but
`GEMINI_API_KEY` is the canonical variable. The process fails fast without the
required Gemini or Convex configuration.

`FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` is optional and server-only. When set, DoryAI uses
Firecrawl once while saving a general public webpage, after the guarded native
fetch has checked its target. It does not call Firecrawl for chat retrieval,
social sources, background refresh, or URLs with credential-shaped query
parameters. The basic proxy avoids automatic enhanced-proxy credit charges.
When Firecrawl is unavailable, the native extractor saves bounded page text.
Either path stores at most 20,000 characters of content.

The X save path can read a bounded public-post text snapshot from X's
oEmbed response when `X_SNAPSHOT_INGESTION_ENABLED=true` is set server-side;
otherwise it keeps the guarded metadata fallback. It uses no paid X API. The
flag is off by default in code. The tested post's oEmbed response contained no
preview image. On this branch, a successful text snapshot also makes a
bounded best-effort read of the same public post's Open Graph image. Only
media hosted on X's image CDN is accepted; failure leaves the text save
intact. This is a preview image, not media analysis, and does not repair
existing records. On 2026-09-27 the flag was enabled in Railway
development and production; a development save, Convex record readback, and
grounded chat retrieval passed. Authenticated production save/readback remains
unverified. The chat flow can also store copies of the text, and there is no
edit/deletion refresh. See the [X ingestion boundary](docs/X-INGESTION.md):
the current X content policy remains an unresolved release risk.

## Commands

```sh
npm run dev
npm run test
npm run build
npm run check
npm run start
```

`npm run check` is the contributor quality gate: focused Node tests followed by
strict TypeScript compilation.

## Supported-source boundary

`src/services/source-url.ts` classifies DoryAI roadmap sources without fetching
them. Instagram Reels and TikTok videos currently use the specialized short
video processor. YouTube videos and Shorts use bounded, cookie-free yt-dlp
metadata plus manual captions when available, falling back to explicitly
labeled automatic captions. When a Short has no captions, DoryAI reuses the
existing bounded short-video audio transcription path; a failed audio fallback
remains metadata-only. If YouTube blocks the server-side metadata process,
DoryAI combines bounded oEmbed metadata with Gemini's direct public-YouTube
video understanding to save a summary and transcript. If Gemini cannot analyze
the video, the result is explicitly metadata-only. YouTube is never treated as
a general webpage. Public LinkedIn posts use bounded preview text when it is
available without sign-in. This is saved as a partial preview, not a full post;
if no usable post text is available, the result is metadata-only. LinkedIn
content is not re-scraped after saving. For new saves, a verified LinkedIn
post redirect is stored as the direct post URL without share-tracking
parameters; unverified or non-post redirects keep the submitted URL. This
does not rewrite existing saved short links.
X has a bounded public-embed adapter behind a disabled-by-default server flag,
with guarded metadata fallback when it is off or the embed yields no text.
Arbitrary HTTP(S) URLs use the general web-page boundary. That
boundary pins each request and redirect to a validated public DNS address,
accepts only standard HTTP(S) ports and HTML, and enforces timeout and
response-size limits. The same guarded transport protects caption and remote
thumbnail downloads.

General webpages save deterministic page metadata plus bounded page text.
Firecrawl main-content markdown is preferred during the save when configured;
the native text is the fallback, not a clean article extraction. A successful
fixture or read-only extraction check is not a live save/readback.

Chat and direct quick-save inputs also accept a public domain without a scheme
(for example, `www.make.ad/path`). DoryAI adds `https://` before analysis and
persists the resulting absolute URL. Explicit `http://` and `https://` are
preserved; malformed domains, credentials in the authority, and other schemes
are rejected. Production acceptance of this input form requires a separate
authenticated save/readback after deployment.

## Security and publication

- Requests to `/api/chat` must carry the shared backend secret and a valid
  user/session identity from Convex.
- Never log or commit environment values, user link contents, transcripts, or
  production payloads.
- Repository visibility, license selection, production deployment, billing,
  and data migrations require explicit owner approval and external readback.

# DoryAI architecture

This document owns the cross-repository runtime map. It describes the current
system; roadmap items are labeled explicitly rather than presented as shipped.

## Components

1. **Next.js web app (`clippo-link`)** renders the landing, authentication,
   dashboard, link-management, settings, and billing-entry experiences.
2. **Clerk** authenticates browser users.
3. **Convex in `clippo-link/convex`** owns application data, user-scoped
   queries/mutations, chat sessions, storage, billing state, and the action that
   calls the private backend.
4. **Express backend (`clippo-backend`)** owns Gemini orchestration and media
   processing that should not execute in the browser or a Convex mutation.
5. **Gemini and source platforms** are external processors/sources. Their
   availability and responses are not controlled by DoryAI.
6. **Polar** is the sole billing provider and defaults to its sandbox outside
   production.

              +----------+-----------+
                         |
                         | privileged, user-bound Convex calls
                         v
                   Convex data/storage
```

The browser must never receive `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `CONVEX_BACKEND_SECRET`,
billing webhook secrets, migration service keys, or provider credentials. The
backend secret authenticates the service boundary but does not replace user
scope: privileged calls still carry and validate the intended user/session.

The development search path, backfill gate, and evaluation requirements are
documented in [SEARCH.md](SEARCH.md). It is not a production release.

## Data ownership

- Convex owns current users, links, categories, subcategories, tags, chat
  sessions/messages, storage references, plan state, and webhook idempotency.
- The backend is stateless apart from bounded in-memory aggregation/deduplication
  and temporary media files. In-memory state is not durable or horizontally
  shared.
- Temporary local/provider media must be cleaned up after processing.

## Source ingestion state

The backend `source-url.ts` boundary recognizes Instagram Reels, TikTok videos,
YouTube long videos/shorts, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, and general HTTP(S) pages.
Recognition is not extraction support.

- **Specialized paths:** Instagram Reels, TikTok videos, and YouTube long-video
  metadata plus available public captions.
- **Restricted-platform paths:** LinkedIn and X first attempt bounded public-page
  metadata and return a labeled URL-only result when access is blocked.
- **General page path:** deterministic metadata and a short local excerpt through
  a transport that blocks local/private targets, revalidates redirects and DNS,
  and limits time, size, and content type.

General webpage text is not forwarded wholesale to Gemini. Live authenticated
save/readback evidence remains separate from fixture and read-only extraction
evidence.

## Billing state

The `/auth/after` route creates monthly or annual Polar checkout through a
server-owned boundary. Stable Clerk-derived customer identity, customer portal,
signature-verified webhook handling, idempotency, and stale-event protection are
implemented. Polar defaults to sandbox. Incomplete configuration fails closed.

## Verification boundaries

- `npm run check` in the web repository runs focused tests and a production
  build.
- `npm run check` in the backend runs focused tests and strict TypeScript
  compilation.
- These commands do not prove live Clerk, Convex, Gemini, source extraction,
  billing, deployment, or rendered UI behavior. Each needs its matching live or
  visual readback before release claims.

## Known architecture gaps

- No durable job queue for long or retryable extraction.
- In-memory aggregation/deduplication is process-local.
- Search currently uses a fixed lexical evaluation and a bounded recent-link
  candidate window; semantic retrieval remains open.
- Authenticated live save, retrieval, and chat failure readbacks remain open.
- The Vercel Preview deployment still needs its own scoped Convex configuration.
- `https://www.doryai.xyz` is the canonical production origin; the apex redirects
  to it.

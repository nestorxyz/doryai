# Saved-link search V2

The Convex functions and backend must deploy together. Existing records do not
need a write migration: the backend searches the new index, then reads older
records through a tenant-scoped, paginated compatibility query. The browser
cards display the combined ranked results.

## Request path

1. Every link create, edit, registration, and content enrichment refreshes a
   bounded, accent-folded `searchText` projection in Convex. It combines title,
   description, source, URL, and saved content. Taxonomy stays in its own
   current records and is filtered separately, so tag/category renames cannot
   leave stale terms in the text index. Deleting a link deletes its projection.
2. The `links.by_search_text` index searches this projection with `userId` as
   an equality filter. `searchLinksForBackend` returns up to 100 candidates to
   the trusted backend, omitting `searchText` from its response. A read-only
   `searchUnindexedLinksForBackend` query pages through that user's older links
   (100 per page) and returns word-matched records lacking `searchText`.
   Backend deduplicates and ranks both sets. The compatibility scan is bounded
   at 50 pages and fails explicitly if that limit is exceeded; it never
   silently returns partial results. For filter-only searches,
   `listLinkMetadataForBackend` pages through the user's link metadata; an
   empty search still returns recent links.
3. Backend `retrieveLinks` applies deterministic ranking and explicit filters,
   returning at most 20 concise results. A detail question may call `get_link`
   once using an ID from those results. The backend checks that ID against the
   current result set and Convex independently verifies its `userId` before
   returning the saved content. The model must cite the saved URL and disclose
   `partial-preview` or `metadata-only` scope.
4. The chat displays up to five compact linked cards in a width-responsive
   grid. Each card shares the library's image-overlay treatment, truncates the
   title after two lines, and keeps a visible partial/metadata-only label.
   Both views use the saved `imgPreview` when available. Older YouTube links
   can display a video-ID thumbnail, and absent or broken images fall back to
   the existing platform artwork. A no-match is explicit. Search does not
   recrawl saved URLs or call Firecrawl; Firecrawl remains a save-time
   extractor for general webpages.

The backend now copies the validated image URL returned by `get_url_info` into
new registrations even when the model omits `img_preview`. Filter-only
paginated searches include stored `imgPreview`; indexed and recent-link
searches already did. Old chat tool responses are immutable and may still lack
image data. A branded fallback is not proof that a real source image was
extracted, especially for Instagram/TikTok pages that block public access.
No existing Convex link was recrawled or migrated by this change.

## Existing links and optional backfill

`links:backfillSearchText` is an internal, idempotent 25-row batch mutation. A
deployment administrator must call it repeatedly with the returned cursor
until `isDone`, then verify a sample of old links and query results. It was run
only against the development deployment during implementation. **Do not run
the production backfill without explicit approval for that data migration.**
The production release does not call this mutation. Older links are included
through the read-only compatibility path above. This avoids changing existing
records but adds read/query cost proportional to a user's library size. A
future backfill would be a separate approval-gated optimization, not a
requirement for search correctness.

## Evaluation and remaining work

- The sanitized backend fixture covers titles, descriptions, taxonomy,
  transcripts, Spanish preview text, URL terms, and no-answer behavior. A
  generated 251-link test proves deterministic ranking can return an older
  candidate when the index supplies it. This does not replace a live >200-link
  tenant integration test.
- Development Convex indexed all 16 existing links. A read-only tenant-scoped
  `AI` query returned seven links, and a selected detail read returned an
  825-character `partial-preview` record. These are integration checks, not an
  authenticated end-to-end chat or visual QA of result cards.
- Branch CI passed for web `195c158` and backend `1ac243c`. Railway dev
  deployment `1d7f4aa5-1b3c-457a-8f3b-6e56816822ad` reached `SUCCESS` and
  its health endpoint returned HTTP 200. The first web Preview failed because
  that branch lacked a Convex deploy key. With owner approval, a new key scoped
  to the existing Convex dev deployment was stored as a Vercel Secret for
  Preview branch `codex/search-v2` only; the unused first attempt was revoked.
  The same branch has public test URLs for the Convex dev deployment and
  Railway dev backend, plus the Clerk test publishable key. No production
  credential was copied.
- Vercel Preview `dpl_AGECWARj3QF9pCjW1zyiU6VexZ1W` rebuilt web commit
  `12e7579` and reached `Ready`. Build logs confirm the Convex schema and
  functions were pushed; the `/dashboard` route redirected to the rendered
  sign-in page. The Convex dev `BACKEND_URL` equals Railway dev, Railway dev
  points to the same Convex dev URL, and their backend secrets match (values
  were compared without printing them). This verifies wiring, not a signed-in
  save/search/detail conversation or visual acceptance.
- Production promotion on 2026-09-30 used web/Convex `77870e2` and backend
  `579f1f4` without a backfill. Branch and main CI, Vercel Production,
  Railway production, public health, and the dashboard passed. An
  authenticated exact-title search returned an older saved YouTube link as
  the first compact image card and chat cited its URL. A broader request for
  the same video missed it and answered incorrectly, so natural-language
  query formulation and relevance remain unresolved. Existing YouTube cards
  loaded a stored image and a video-ID thumbnail fallback.
- Remaining: a live authenticated Preview save/search/detail check, a
  >200-link isolated corpus, negative/cross-tenant search checks, and a
  mobile-width visual check. Record recall@5, MRR@5, grounding, latency, and
  provider cost against a fixed evaluation set. Do not claim semantic
  paraphrase coverage from this lexical implementation; embeddings remain a
  separate, measurement-gated phase.

The existing X/LinkedIn stored-content policy risks still apply to search and
chat copies of saved text. Do not present this technical work as provider
permission or legal clearance.

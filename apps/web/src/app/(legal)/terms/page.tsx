            <h2 id="s1">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>
              These Terms of Service (“Terms”) constitute a legally binding
              agreement between you and Misfit Labs, doing business as DoryAI
              (“we,” “us,” or “our”). By accessing or using DoryAI’s AI-powered
              link assistant service (the “Platform”), you agree to be bound by
              these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the
              Platform. You represent that you have the legal authority to enter
              into this agreement, and if acting on behalf of an organization,
              you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.
            </p>

            <h2 id="s2">2. Modifications to Terms</h2>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will
              notify you of any material changes by updating the “Last Revised”
              date and, where appropriate, providing additional notice through
              the Platform or via email.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your continued use of the Platform after any modifications
              constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree
              to the modifications, you must discontinue use of the Platform.
            </p>

            </p>

              You grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to access, process,

              The Platform is provided “as is” and “as available” without
